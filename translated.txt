TOP SECRET:
The monotonians are immune to most things, almost invincible - 
there is however, only one catchy (and by catchy we mean torturous) 
tune that when fed into their computers will stop them for good 
and send them back to their planet Monotone... here it is... 
you know what to do with this... good luck!  

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

A song by Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up.

That's right... you've been rickrolled! :D
